# Family Reunion Helper
## AKA: Something To Talk About
This app will take a collection of peopleâ€™s birthdays and create a concise document of things that happened on each of the birthdays. It would be used for planning family reunions to generate a document that includes the collection of reunion attendees and the events and details of life at the time of their birthdays.

Give a calendar date and this app will detail what life was like at that point in time.
